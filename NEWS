Movit 1.1, April 10th, 2014

 - NOTE: Movit now uses libepoxy rather than GLEW. This is needed because
   of core context and GLES3 support (see below). Movit 1.1 should be
   generally API-compatible with 1.0.3 (with the exception of the next
   point), but is not ABI-compatible, so there has been a soname bump
   to libmovit.so.2.

 - NOTE: The rules for using an EffectChain or ResourcePool in multiple
   OpenGL contexts or threads have changed somewhat; see the comments in
   resource_pool.h.

 - Movit will now work in OpenGL core contexts, and on GLES 3.0 or newer.
   (GLES2 devices are not supported.) This also holds for all unit tests,
   provided that you use SDL2 and not SDL1 (because SDL2 is needed to set
   up such contexts). Note that the included demo application still requires
   a classic OpenGL context.

 - ResampleEffect can now do sub-pixel translate and/or zoom.

 - LumaMixEffect now has an “invert” flag, as a convenience to e.g. change
   a left-to-right wipe into a right-to-left one.

 - Significant reduction in driver overhead, especially on NVIDIA drivers.

 - Various smaller bugfixes and performance improvements.
