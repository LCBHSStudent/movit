	// There are two good reasons why you might want to set this:

	//     expansion, to happen pre-filtering instead of post-filtering.
	//     (This is only relevant if you actually need the filtering; if
	//     you sample 1:1 between pixels and texels, it makes no difference.)

	// Note that in some cases, you might get post-filtered gamma expansion
	// even when setting this option. More specifically, if you are the
	// first effect in the chain, and the GPU is doing sRGB gamma
